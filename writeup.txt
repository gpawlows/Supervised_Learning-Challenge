Considering the Models -

After looking at the dataset and considering the two model types, I believe that the logistic regression model 
will perform better for this dataset.  Both Random Forest and Logistic Regression models are good for classification 
problems, but I believe with over 80 variables to consider, the Logistic model will win out.  Based on my research, 
Random Forest is recommended for simpler classification problems.  

Evaluating the Models - without scaling the data, the Random Forest model performed better on the test data.  Perhaps my understanding 
of what a "simple" classification problem is is lacking, or the lack of scaling the data influenced the results.  

Results w/ Scaling - Once I scaled the data, the logistic regression became the better classifier. It had an accuracy score of .66.  
The Random Forest model decreased in accuracy from .64 to .5.  From what I understand, this is to be expected as Random Forest modeling
doesn't rely on scaled data to make accurate calculations, while logistic regression models do.  

While I was able to produce a model with a .66 accuracy metric, I would be concerned about employing this out into the wild for credit 
worthiness rating purposes.  There is still far too much inaccuracy, in my opinion, and money would be lost on a consistent basis if 
loan decisions were based on this model.
